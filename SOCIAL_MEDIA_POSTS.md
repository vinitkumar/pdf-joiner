🐧 Calling all Linux developers! 

My PDF joiner tool works great on macOS, but needs Linux love! Looking for contributors to add cross-platform support using native Linux tools (pdfunite, ghostscript, etc.)

Great opportunity to contribute to open source! 🚀

🚀 **Open Source Collaboration Opportunity: Linux Support Needed!**

I've built a simple command-line PDF joiner tool that works seamlessly on macOS using native system utilities. Now I'm looking for talented developers to help make it truly cross-platform by adding Linux support!

**What we're looking for:**
• Go developers familiar with Linux systems
• Experience with PDF processing tools (pdfunite, ghostscript, pdftk, qpdf)
• Interest in contributing to open source projects

**What you'll gain:**
✅ Real-world Go programming experience
✅ Open source contribution for your portfolio
✅ Recognition as a project contributor
✅ Experience with cross-platform development

The project uses a clean, simple architecture and we've outlined exactly what needs to be implemented. It's a perfect opportunity for developers looking to make their first meaningful open source contribution or expand their Go skills.

**Technical approach:** We want to maintain the same simplicity as the macOS version by leveraging native Linux PDF tools that are commonly available across distributions.

Let's make this tool available to the entire Linux community! 🐧
